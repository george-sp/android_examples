## How it works
- Tap the Buy button and enter the fake Visa credit card from before.  Feel free to enter any valid shipping/billing address, this is all sandboxed.

- Once you've selected your payment credentials, click the Confirm button.  The Toast displays the Full Wallet Response one time card number.

- You can take the payment information and then pass it to your payment processor and process it like a regular credit card.

### Fake Credentials
You should see a Buy button.
Clicking the button will bring up a payment method screen where you can select a credit card and billing address.
Donâ€™t worry, we are using the sandbox environment so no charges you make in this codelab will be real.

If you want to enter a credit card, use the following information:
- Card Type: Visa
- Card Number: 4111 1111 1111 1111
- CVC: any three digits
- Expiration: any date in the future
